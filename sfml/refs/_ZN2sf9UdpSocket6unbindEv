    /// \brief Unbind the socket from the local port to which it is bound
    ///
    /// The port that the socket was previously bound to is immediately
    /// made available to the operating system after this function is called.
    /// This means that a subsequent call to bind() will be able to re-bind
    /// the port if no other process has done so in the mean time.
    /// If the socket is not bound to a port, this function has no effect.
    ///
    /// \see bind
