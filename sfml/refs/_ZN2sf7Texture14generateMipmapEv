    /// \brief Generate a mipmap using the current texture data
    ///
    /// Mipmaps are pre-computed chains of optimized textures. Each
    /// level of texture in a mipmap is generated by halving each of
    /// the previous level&apos;s dimensions. This is done until the final
    /// level has the size of 1x1. The textures generated in this process may
    /// make use of more advanced filters which might improve the visual quality
    /// of textures when they are applied to objects much smaller than they are.
    /// This is known as minification. Because fewer texels (texture elements)
    /// have to be sampled from when heavily minified, usage of mipmaps
    /// can also improve rendering performance in certain scenarios.
    ///
    /// Mipmap generation relies on the necessary OpenGL extension being
    /// available. If it is unavailable or generation fails due to another
    /// reason, this function will return false. Mipmap data is only valid from
    /// the time it is generated until the next time the base level image is
    /// modified, at which point this function will have to be called again to
    /// regenerate it.
    ///
    /// \return True if mipmap generation was successful, false if unsuccessful
    ///
